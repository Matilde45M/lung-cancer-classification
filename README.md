# Lung Cancer Classification using CT Data

This project addresses the problem of lung cancer classification using Computed Tomography (CT) data and machine learning techniques.
The goal is to support early diagnosis by automatically assessing lung nodule malignancy.

## Context
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide.
Early detection is critical to improve survival rates, motivating the development of data-driven decision support systems.

## Dataset
The project is based on the LIDC-IDRI dataset, a public lung cancer screening dataset containing thoracic CT scans with expert annotations.
